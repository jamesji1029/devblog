## What is OOP(Object Oriented Program)?

### Simple concept of OOP

OOP is a programming method using classes and objects. To compare this method with a car factory, a class is a blueprint of a car, and an object is a car created using the class, the blueprint. By creating classes, the rough blueprint, objects could be produced quickly even though there are slight variations in various objects.

## Using Class with Kotlin

### Creating a class "Car"

**Description of the code above:**
I first created a `Car` class with variables, such as String type `color`, String type `modelName`, and Integer type `speed` set by 0.  
After initializing those variables, I created functions like "brake()" and "accelerate()."  

- fun `brake()`: while the speed is above 0, reduce the speed by 1 so the speed could be 0. And each time the function is activated, print the speed value.
- fun `accelerate(maxSpeed : Int)`: while the speed is below the maximum speed declared, add the speed by 1 so it can reach the maximum speed. And each time the function is activated, print the speed value.  

### Testing the class "Car"

I first declared the variables: car `color` as "red," and car `modelName` as "porsche."  
Then, I tested whether `myCar.color` and the color "red" are same by putting them in "assertEquals()" function. The result was "Tests passed" as shown in the picture above.  
Also, I set the maximum speed as 4 in the "accelerate()" function and put "brake()" function after. Therefore, as shown in the "Run" section, the speed increased from 0 to 4, and decreased back to 0.
