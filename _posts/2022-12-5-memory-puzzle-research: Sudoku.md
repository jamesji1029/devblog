## Objective

This article introduces the puzzle `Sudoku` and how it affects player's brain.

You can play the puzzle `Sudoku` by clicking this [**link**](https://sudoku.com/)

## Introduction

In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a **9 × 9 grid** with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine **3 × 3 subgrids** that compose the grid, also called "boxes", contain all of the digits from **1 to 9**.  
 The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

## How to play Sudoku properly (Rules)

### Rule 1. Use numbers from 1 to 9

A **9 x 9 grid** is used to play Sudoku. There are nine "squares" in the rows and columns (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). You must fill out all nine slots in each row, column, and square with the numbers **1 through 9**, without repeating any numbers.

### Rule 2. Don’t Repeat Any Numbers

We can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to determine which numbers should belong in each empty area by examining which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column.

### Rule 3. Don't guess

You shouldn't have to guess because sudoku is a game of logic and reasoning. If you are unsure of what to put in a particular space, keep looking at the other parts of the grid until you see a chance to do so.

### Rule 4. Use Process of Elimination

Since there cannot be a duplicate of the numbers 1 through 9 within a square, one method of determining which numbers can fit in each space is to use the "process of elimination" by looking to see which other numbers are already included within each square.

## How it improves your brain

A wonderful game to help with memory improvement is sudoku because of the fact that Sudoku often uses a set of numbers that go in specific locations.  
It also helps because many of the daily Sudoku problems available online are timed. Your memory can be improved when you have to recall how to perform something in a specific period of time. It functions very much like a memory matching game. Once you've solved the puzzles countless times, it gets simple.
