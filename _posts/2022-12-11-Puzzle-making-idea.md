## Background

Our team is planning on making a puzzle game that improves player's memorization ability and exercises palyer's brain.

## Puzzle Idea

Among many candidates and ideas, we primarily selected the puzzle called `따라길찾기`, a.k.a `Navigating Game` (temporary).  
The main goal of this game is to let the player memorize and follow the path(pattern) that the computer randomly generated.  
The figure below is the first rough idea created during brainstorming:

## Basic Rule of the Puzzle (rough)

- Starting from the bottom right, the top left is the exit
- The computer randomly shows the way from the entrance to the exit (a few seconds)
- Remember the path and follow the same path that the computer generated by touching the blocks.
- The total number of boxes increases when the path is correct.
- If the player memorizes wrongly, the game restarts.

## Future Concepts of the Game

The story of [`Hansel and Gretel`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) will be the main story of our navigating game.  
Therefore, the concept of our game will be like one of the pictures below:
